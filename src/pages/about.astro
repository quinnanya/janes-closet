      </header>
      <p>
        Ukrainian war memes are an important born-digital element of contemporary culture. They are disseminated mainly
        through social media and transmit very powerful war-related messages in a playful manner. Because memes are
        strongly rooted in current events and ideas, their life span is very short and if not preserved, they will be
        lost. To preserve this cultural phenomenon SUCHO has begun building an archival collection of visual internet
        memes related to the Russo-Ukrainian war. The collecting is carried out by harvesting social media accounts
        dedicated to memes and by manual submission of individual memes via a public Google form. Each meme is described
        using a complex metadata structure. The collection can be previewed as an interactive “SUCHO Meme Wall”, where
        memes can be filtered or searched by content, language and template as well as by the names of individuals and
        countries mentioned.

        <h2>About the Site</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        This site is built directly from curated submissions to <a title="SUCHO Meme Submission Form"
          href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdhi-nky_fICuBD-HKaGsQi_ezukKtU3oVeMulMg0Ra8TCnvw/viewform">the
          Google Form</a>. At build-time, the contents of the sheet is fetched and parsed, and the source images are
        downloaded from the Google Drive folder. The images are then processed to create the versions in multiple
        sizes/formats required to create the site.
      </p>
      <p>
        The front-end site itself is created in HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript using the <a title="Astro"
          href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> static framework. The site is hosted on GitHub Pages and <a
          href="https://github.com/sucho-archiving/meme-wall/" title="SUCHO Meme Wall Repository">the source is
          available on GitHub</a>.
